## NBA Shot Chart
A repository to update and maintain two NBA basketball R Shiny applications:
 * Lineup comparison application
 * Shot chart

This project used to work, but nba.com made changes to their API.  I will also include additional information on what each application does and how it works.

The URLs for the apps as they currently exists are here:
 * https://markgroner.shinyapps.io/shot_chart/
 * https://markgroner.shinyapps.io/lineup_comparison/
